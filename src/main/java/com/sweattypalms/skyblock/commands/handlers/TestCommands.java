Roses?\n" + "Roses!\n" + "Vanessa!\n" + "Roses?!\n" + "Barry?\n" + "Roses are flowers!\n" + "Yes, they are.\n" + "Flowers, bees, pollen!\n" + "I know.\n" + "That's why this is the last parade.\n" + "Maybe not.\n" + "Could you ask him to slow down?\n" + "Could you slow down?\n" + "Barry!\n" + "OK, I made a huge mistake.\n" + "This is a total disaster, all my fault.\n" + "Yes, it kind of is.\n" + "I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse.\n" + "Actually, it's completely closed down.\n" + "I thought maybe you were remodeling.\n" + "But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.\n" + "I don't want to hear it!\n" + "All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.\n" + "I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.\n" + "All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.\n" + "Bees.\n" + "Park.\n" + "Pollen!\n" + "Flowers.\n" + "Repollination!\n" + "Across the nation!\n" + "Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, California.\n" + "They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.\n" + "Security will be tight.\n" + "I have an idea.\n" + "Vanessa Bloome, FTD.\n" + "Official floral business. It's real.\n" + "Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.\n" + "Thank you. It was a gift.\n" + "Once inside, we just pick the right float.\n" + "How about The Princess and the Pea?\n" + "I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!\n" + "Yes, I got it.\n" + "Where should I sit?\n" + "What are you?\n" + "I believe I'm the pea.\n" + "The pea?\n" + "It goes under the mattresses.\n" + "Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.\n" + "I'm getting the marshal.\n" + "You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!\n" + "Let's see what this baby'll do.\n" + "Hey, what are you doing?!\n" + "Then all we do is blend in with traffic... without arousing suspicion.\n" + "Once at the airport, there's no stopping us.\n" + "Stop! Security.\n" + "You and your insect pack your float?\n" + "Yes.\n" + "Has it been in your possession the entire time?\n" + "Would you remove your shoes?\n" + "Remove your stinger.\n" + "It's part of me.\n" + "I know. Just having some fun.\n" + "Enjoy your flight.\n" + "Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.\n" + "Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!\n" + "I think this is gonna work.\n" + "It's got to work.\n" + "Attention, passengers, this is Captain Scott. We have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.\n" + "Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.\n" + "I gotta get up there and talk to them.\n" + "Be careful.\n" + "Can I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.\n" + "Captain, I'm in a real situation.\n" + "What'd you say, Hal?\n" + "Nothing.\n" + "Bee!\n" + "Don't freak out! My entire species...\n" + "What are you doing?\n" + "Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!\n" + "Who's an attorney?\n" + "Don't move.\n" + "Oh, Barry.\n" + "Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And please hurry!\n" + "What happened here?\n" + "There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.\n" + "One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!\n" + "Is that another bee joke?\n" + "No!\n" + "No one's flying the plane!\n" + "This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?\n" + "This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.\n" + "Where's the pilot?\n" + "He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.\n" + "Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?\n" + "As a matter of fact, there is.\n" + "Who's that?\n" + "Barry Benson.\n" + "From the honey trial?! Oh, great.\n" + "Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.\n" + "It's got giant wings, huge engines.\n" + "I can't fly a plane.\n" + "Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?\n" + "Yes.\n" + "How hard could it be?\n" + "Wait, Barry!\n" + "We're headed into some lightning.\n" + "This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing.\n" + "Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...\n" + "That's Barry!\n" + "...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew.\n" + "Flowers?!\n" + "We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience.\n" + "Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.\n" + "I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.\n" + "They've done enough damage.\n" + "But isn't he your only hope?\n" + "Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.\n" + "Their wings are too small... Haven't we heard this a million times?\n" + "\"The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.\"\n" + "Get this on the air!\n" + "Got it.\n" + "Stand by.\n" + "We're going live.\n" + "The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.\n" + "But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference.\n" + "More than we realized. To us, to everyone.\n" + "That's why I want to get bees back to working together. That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.\n" + "We get behind a fellow.\n" + "Black and yellow!\n" + "Hello!\n" + "Left, right, down, hover.\n" + "Hover?\n" + "Forget hover.\n" + "This isn't so hard.\n" + "Beep-beep! Beep-beep!\n" + "Barry, what happened?!\n" + "Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.\n" + "That may have been helping me.\n" + "And now we're not!\n" + "So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.\n" + "All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!\n" + "Move out!\n" + "Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!\n" + "Don't have to yell.\n" + "I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.\n" + "It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!\n" + "It's not a tone. I'm panicking!\n" + "I can't do this!\n" + "Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!\n" + "You snap out of it.\n" + "You snap out of it.\n" + "You snap out of it!\n" + "You snap out of it!\n" + "You snap out of it!\n" + "You snap out of it!\n" + "You snap out of it!\n" + "You snap out of it!\n" + "Hold it!\n" + "Why? Come on, it's my turn.\n" + "How is the plane flying?\n" + "I don't know.\n" + "Hello?\n" + "Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?\n" + "The Pollen Jocks!\n" + "They do get behind a fellow.\n" + "Black and yellow.\n" + "Hello.\n" + "All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.\n" + "Where? I can't see anything. Can you?\n" + "No, nothing. It's all cloudy.\n" + "Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.\n" + "Thinking bee.\n" + "Thinking bee.\n" + "Thinking bee!\n" + "Thinking bee! Thinking bee!\n" + "Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.\n" + "What?\n" + "I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.\n" + "Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.\n" + "Bring the nose down.\n" + "Thinking bee!\n" + "Thinking bee! Thinking bee!\n" + "What in the world is on the tarmac?\n" + "Get some lights on that!\n" + "Thinking bee!\n" + "Thinking bee! Thinking bee!\n" + "Vanessa, aim for the flower.\n" + "OK.\n" + "Cut the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?\n" + "Affirmative!\n" + "Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.\n" + "Land on that flower!\n" + "Ready? Full reverse!\n" + "Spin it around!\n" + "Not that flower! The other one!\n" + "Which one?\n" + "That flower.\n" + "I'm aiming at the flower!\n" + "That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.\n" + "I mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees!\n" + "Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.\n" + "Rotate around it.\n" + "This is insane, Barry!\n" + "This's the only way I know how to fly.\n" + "Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?\n" + "Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!\n" + "Just drop it. Be a part of it.\n" + "Aim for the center!\n" + "Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!\n" + "Come on, already.\n" + "Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!\n" + "Yes. No high-five!\n" + "Right.\n" + "Barry, it worked!\n" + "Did you see the giant flower?\n" + "What giant flower? Where? Of course\n" + "I saw the flower! That was genius!\n" + "Thank you.\n" + "But we're not done yet.\n" + "Listen, everyone!\n" + "This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.\n" + "That means this is our Last Chance. We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.\n" + "If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?\n" + "Are we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History keychains?\n" + "We're bees!\n" + "Keychain!\n" + "Then follow me! Except Keychain.\n" + "Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this.\n" + "Yeah!\n" + "I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.\n" + "Oh, yeah.\n" + "That's our Barry.\n" + "Mom! The bees are back!\n" + "If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!\n" + "Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Can I help who's next?\n" + "Would you like some honey with that?\n" + "It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.\n" + "Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.  And I don't see a nickel!\n" + "Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!\n" + "I had no idea.\n" + "Barry, I'm sorry.\n" + "Have you got a moment?\n" + "Would you excuse me?\n" + "My mosquito associate will help you.\n" + "Sorry I'm late.\n" + "He's a lawyer too?\n" + "I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.\n" + "Have a great afternoon!\n" + "Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.\n" + "No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.\n" + "You're a lifesaver, Barry. Can I help who's next?\n" + "All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.\n" + "Thank you, Barry!\n" + "That bee is living my life!\n" + "Let it go, Kenny.\n" + "When will this nightmare end?!\n" + "Let it all go.\n" + "Beautiful day to fly.\n" + "Sure is.\n" + "Between you and me,\n" + "I was dying to get out of that office.\n" + "You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.\n" + "Thinking bee!\n" + "Me?\n" + "Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.\n" + "I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Can we stop here?\n" + "I'm not making a major life decision during a production number!\n" + "All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.\n" + "I had virtually no rehearsal for that.";
